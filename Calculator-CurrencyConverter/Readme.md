### ***Issue***

### üêõ Issue: Invisible Button Text on macOS

While testing the Project on macOS, I ran into a critical UI issue: all `tkinter` button labels were invisible. The buttons themselves were clickable and functional‚Äîbut without visible text, the interface became unusable.

### üîç Root Cause

This issue stems from macOS shipping with an outdated version of **Tcl/Tk (v8.5)**, which has known rendering bugs with standard `tkinter` widgets‚Äîespecially buttons.

---

### ‚úÖ Solution: Switch to `ttk.Button`

The fix was simple but effective: replace `tk.Button` with `ttk.Button`, the themed widget from `tkinter.ttk`, which supports modern OS styling and works correctly with macOS.

#### üîß Before (Buggy on macOS):

```python
import tkinter as tk

my_button = tk.Button(root, text="Click Me")
```

#### ‚úîÔ∏è After (Works Everywhere):

```python
from tkinter import ttk

my_button = ttk.Button(root, text="Click Me")
```

This small change restored button labels on macOS and improved the overall UI consistency across platforms.

## üîß Technical Details

### Key Classes
- **FinancialApp**: Main application window and styling setup
- **CalculatorFrame**: Handles all calculator modes and computations
- **CurrencyConverterFrame**: Manages currency conversion and API calls

## üé® Customization

You can easily customize the vintage theme by modifying these constants:
```python
HANDWRITTEN = "Comic Sans MS"    # Font family
CREAM_BG = "#FAF3E0"            # Background color
PAPER_BG = "#F5E6C4"            # Paper background
INK_DARK = "#5B4636"            # Text color
```

## üêõ Known Issues

- **Internet connection required** for currency conversion
- **Font fallback**: If Comic Sans MS is not available, system will use default font
- **Cross-platform styling**: Some styling may vary between operating systems
